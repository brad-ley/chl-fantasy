Fully-functioning discord-bot-based WHL fantasy league. 
Includes:
- Adding and deleting teams
- Adding players and goalies to each team
- Midweek additions and point calculations that reflect them
- Displaying lists of all available players and goalies, ranked most-to-least fantasy points

Can easily be ported to OHL or QMJHL (or any other league with some tweaks). Deployed on Heroku and utilizes a Postgres database add-on for data storage.
